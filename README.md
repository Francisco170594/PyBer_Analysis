# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of th analysis
We'll be performing an exploratoy analysis on Pyber (a ride-sharing app) data, by creating visualizations that showcase the relatiosnhip between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. Our analysis and visualizations will help Pyber imporve access to ride sharing services and determinte affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
-After we merged our datasets, and made new dataframes, one for each city type (urban, rural and suburban) we created a scatter plot, in wich each dot represents a city, and the size of each dot represents the number of rides registered. The y-axis represents the average fare. We see that rural areas have lower access to Pyber services, which translates in fewer rides in those areas and higher fares per ride as well.

- Another look at these situation can be expressed in a bos and whiskers plot

- The scarce number of rides in rural cities respond to the low number of drivers in such areas

- By not having as many costumers as urban or suburban areas, the average fare un rural cities goes up to 12 dollars above the averages on more populated citites
